# jsramverkBTH

Welcome to my course repo for the course *jsramverk*, currently running on the university *Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola*.

---

This repo currently houses my reports and different information, and also houses the work i do on the front-end and the back-end during this course. Currently I have not installed that many different modules to support this cause (other than a module to help me render some markdown texts). 

The way to install modules to this repo is to simply get ahold of a copy of the files in the repository, and then using a command-line interpreter to enter into the folder containing the main files. AFter this, running the command `npm install *package-name*` will install the package you chose with the name *package-name*.

---

After this, you can simply run the command `npm start` to start my application and browse around on my webapp.

# Enjoy your stay!
